## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-5

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0143
**Parent Title:** Technological Obsolescence and Populist Voting: Evidence from U.S. Metropolitan Areas
**Parent Decision:** MAJOR REVISION (2/3 majority)
**Revision Rationale:** Data correction. Parent paper used fabricated/incorrect data instead of the actual technology vintage data provided by Prof. Tarek Hassan via Dropbox. This revision uses the correct data source.

## Key Changes Planned

1. **Use correct data source** - Replace fabricated modal_age.dta with Tarek Hassan's actual CSV from Dropbox
2. **Re-run all analyses** - Regenerate all results using real data
3. **Update data provenance** - Correctly cite Tarek Hassan as data source
4. **Add correspondence note** - Document the data correction in appendix per Tarek's feedback

## Correspondence from Prof. Tarek Hassan (February 2026)

> "Hi David,
>
> Thanks so much, this is great. I had a look and it seems it took data from some other (Acemoglu) paper, rather than from the dropbox link I sent. Can you try again with this link (this time as csv)?

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **Data authenticity** - Primary concern: using real data from Prof. Hassan
2. **Methodology unchanged** - Cross-sectional + gains + 2008 baseline approach retained
3. **Results to be updated** - All coefficients will be re-estimated with real data

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Does technological obsolescence predict support for populist candidates?
- Identification strategy: Cross-sectional + gains + 2008 baseline controls (observational)
- Primary data source: Technology vintage data from Prof. Tarek Hassan (corrected)
