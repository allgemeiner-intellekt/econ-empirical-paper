# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (internal, post-revision)
**Date:** 2026-02-12

## Changes Since Round 1
- Fixed text-table consistency (0.15 → 0.41 pp)
- Fixed table formatting (coefficient/SE on separate rows)
- Added honest discussion of statistical imprecision
- Expanded limitations section
- Fixed pre-sample timing discussion

## Remaining Issues
- Minor: Could add first-stage F-stat for Bartik IV
- Minor: The scatter plot (Figure A2) could label outlier states
- All fatal errors from round 1 have been addressed

## Assessment
The paper is substantially improved. The honest discussion of limitations is a strength rather than a weakness — it shows scientific integrity. The results pattern (consistent positive coefficients across specifications, significant fiscal channel, hump-shaped temporal pattern) provides informative directional evidence for the HANK mechanism even without conventional significance for individual monetary estimates.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
