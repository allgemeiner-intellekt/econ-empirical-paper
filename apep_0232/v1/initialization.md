## User Responses

1. Surprise me — targeting macroeconomics with causal identification, Nakamura-Steinsson style
2. Surprise me — open to DiD, shift-share IV, local projections, whatever fits best
3. Modern (implied — macro data availability)
4. Yes — all API keys configured (FRED, BEA, Census, IPUMS, etc.)
5. Yes — tri-model external reviews
6. Novel angle — known macro policy + established data + fresh HANK/heterogeneous-agent theoretical connection
7. Target NBER Macroeconomics Summer Institute level. Connect to cutting-edge empirical macro (HANK, heterogeneous agents). All APEP papers are applied micro — this should be genuinely macroeconomic. Nakamura-Steinsson style = cross-state variation for causal identification but answering macro questions.

## Setup Results

- **Domain:** Macroeconomics / fiscal-monetary policy transmission
- **Method:** To be determined (shift-share IV, local projections, or DiD — whichever best fits the question)
- **Data era:** Modern
- **Risk appetite:** Novel angle
- **Other preferences:** NBER Macro SI level; connect to HANK/heterogeneous agents literature; use cross-regional variation for causal identification of macro parameters
