# Internal Review - Round 1

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (internal)
**Date:** 2026-02-12

## Format Check
- Length: ~25 pages main text (adequate)
- References: Comprehensive (20+ entries, covers HANK, LP, monetary shocks)
- Prose: Full paragraphs throughout, no bullet-point sections
- Tables: All 6 tables have real numbers from regressions

## Statistical Methodology
- Driscoll-Kraay SEs used throughout (appropriate for common shocks)
- N reported for all regressions
- Permutation inference supplements parametric inference
- Key concern: main interaction coefficient γ^24 = 0.41 (SE=0.30) is imprecisely estimated (t≈1.4)
- The paper is honest about this limitation

## Identification
- BRW shocks are well-identified (high-frequency, free of info effects)
- Cross-state HtM variation is pre-determined (averaged over time)
- Horse race controls for homeownership channel
- Permutation inference provides nonparametric p-value

## Key Strengths
1. Novel research question connecting HANK theory to cross-regional evidence
2. Multiple HtM proxies and robustness checks
3. Complementary fiscal channel analysis with Bartik IV
4. Honest discussion of imprecision and limitations

## Key Weaknesses
1. Main monetary estimates lack conventional significance
2. IV fiscal estimates are very noisy (SE > coefficient)
3. SNAP proxy yields wrong-sign coefficient
4. Sub-period analysis shows effect concentrated pre-GFC

## Suggestions
1. Report first-stage F-statistics for Bartik IV
2. Consider binscatter visualization of HtM vs employment sensitivity
3. Discuss power calculation more explicitly

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
