# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Date:** 2026-02-06

## Summary of Round 1 Issues Addressed

1. **Network exposure definitions clarified** - Section 3 now clearly distinguishes Full Network MW vs Out-of-State MW
2. **Sample sizes reconciled** - Descriptive sample (133,761) is now described as a filtered subset of regression sample (135,744)
3. **Balance test discrepancies explained** - Main IV p = 0.094, distance IVs p = 0.000 (different tests)
4. **300km coefficient flagged** - Table notes warn this is implausible due to weak instrument

## Remaining Issues

1. **Earnings significance marginal** - $\beta = 0.21$, p = 0.03 is significant but not robust to multiple testing
2. **Employment effect not significant** - p = 0.12, though economically meaningful

## Decision

The paper has addressed the major internal consistency issues from Round 1. It is ready for external review.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
