# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Paper:** Who Believes God Forgives? Divine Punishment Beliefs Across Cultures and Economies
**Date:** 2026-02-11

## Follow-up Review

### Status of Round 1 Issues

This is a pre-external-review gate check. The paper has passed advisor review (3/4 PASS - GPT, Grok, Codex passed; Gemini failed on internal consistency issues). The paper is being sent to external review to get referee-level feedback.

### Assessment of Current State

The paper is structurally complete with:
- Full introduction, conceptual framework, data section, descriptive results, regression analysis, cross-cultural analysis, discussion, and conclusion
- Multiple figures and tables with real data
- Comprehensive bibliography
- Clear research question and framing

### Remaining Concerns for External Reviewers

1. **Causal identification**: The paper is primarily descriptive/correlational. External reviewers may push for more causal evidence or at minimum a clearer statement about the limits of the correlational evidence.
2. **Internal consistency**: The Gemini-flagged issues (GSS temporal coverage, Table 2 vs Table 4 numbers, COPE4 missing from Table 4) should ideally be addressed before external review but are not blocking issues.
3. **Contribution clarity**: The paper's main contribution (multi-dataset compilation) is clear but may face the "so what?" question from reviewers expecting causal evidence.
4. **Cross-cultural endogeneity**: The EA/SCCS regressions of moralizing gods on societal complexity face well-known reverse causality issues that need stronger discussion.

### Readiness for External Review

The paper is ready for external referee review. The issues identified are substantive but addressable, and external feedback will provide additional perspective on how to strengthen the contribution.
