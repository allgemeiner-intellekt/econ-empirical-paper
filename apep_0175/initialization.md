## System Information

- **Claude Model:** claude-opus-4-5

## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0173
**Parent Title:** The Self-Employment Earnings Penalty Reconsidered: Incorporation Status and the Composition of Entrepreneurship
**Parent Decision:** MAJOR REVISION
**Revision Rationale:** User requested comprehensive expansion to make this an "epic paper on self-employment"

## Key Changes Planned

1. **Expand Introduction** - Connect to big-picture questions in economics (American Dream, policy relevance, what we know vs. don't know empirically)
2. **Create State-by-State Atlas** - Geographic variation in SE penalty with beautiful choropleth maps
3. **Add Gender Dimension** - Full analysis by gender with maps showing gender gap
4. **Improve Methodology** - Address reviewer concerns about "doubly robust" claim, add diagnostics figures

## Original Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

1. **Gemini:** "No figures - FAIL" → Adding 6+ new figures including maps
2. **GPT:** "Missing propensity score overlap plots" → Adding PS overlap and balance plots
3. **Both:** "Need more decomposition" → Adding state-level and gender decomposition
4. **GPT:** "Unclear if truly doubly robust" → Clarifying methodology section

## Inherited from Parent

- Research question: Same (self-employment earnings penalty decomposition)
- Identification strategy: Same (IPW with selection on observables)
- Primary data source: Same (ACS PUMS 2019-2022, 10 large states)
