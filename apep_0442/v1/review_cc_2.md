# Internal Review - Claude Code (Round 2)

**Role:** Follow-up review after revisions
**Paper:** The First Retirement Age: Civil War Pensions and Elderly Labor Supply at the Age-62 Threshold

---

## Changes Since Round 1

All major issues from Round 1 have been addressed:

1. **Density test:** Now reports exact T-statistic and p-value with clear explanation for rejection.
2. **Literacy imbalance:** Three mitigating arguments in text, plus literacy-controlled RDD in robustness table showing estimate unchanged (0.1657 vs 0.1635).
3. **Table completeness:** Total N, effective N, bandwidths all reported consistently.
4. **Bias-corrected inference:** Now correctly uses robust SE for bias-corrected column.
5. **Kernel robustness:** Panel E added with Epanechnikov and uniform kernel results.
6. **Conceptual framework:** Properly reframed as reduced-form effect of automatic eligibility threshold, acknowledging pre-62 disability pensions.

## Remaining Concerns

1. The paper remains underpowered --- this is a fundamental data limitation, not a fixable error.
2. The positive (wrong-sign) point estimate is honestly reported but limits the paper's contribution.

## Assessment

The paper is now internally consistent, complete, and honest about its limitations. The design validation contribution is genuine. Ready for external review.
