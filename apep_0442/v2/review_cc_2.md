# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (self-review, post-revision)
**Paper:** The First Retirement Age (after addressing Round 1 feedback)

---

## Changes Since Round 1
- Tightened prose in results section
- Added explicit MDE discussion
- Removed "Literate vs. illiterate" claim where only literate subgroup estimated
- Converted border state table to inline results (N_left=13 too small for table)
- Fixed all sample count inconsistencies (3,800 not 5,000)
- Fixed section cross-reference (Section 9 not 10)
- Fixed pooled regression model to match stated equation
- Added Professional variable definition
- Clarified bandwidth-specific N vs full-sample N

## Assessment
All critical issues from Round 1 and advisor reviews have been addressed. The paper passes the advisor review (3/4: GPT, Grok, Codex). Remaining Gemini concerns are structural (small samples produce wide CIs in LPM) rather than methodological errors.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
