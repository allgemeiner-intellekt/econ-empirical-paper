# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal - Editor Mode)
**Paper:** Medicaid Postpartum Coverage Extensions and PHE Unwinding
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Review Summary

Round 1 identified the paper as MINOR REVISION. Key remaining issues addressed in this round:

1. **Data-design alignment clarified:** Treatment cohorts now properly restricted to 2021-2022 adopters with 22 control states. Text explicitly documents coding rules.
2. **Reproducibility:** set.seed() added to all bootstrap procedures.
3. **Table completeness:** N, treated/control counts added to Table 2.
4. **Jurisdiction counts:** Consistent use of "jurisdictions" throughout.
5. **SE consistency:** Rounded to match table values.

## Remaining Items (Minor)

1. The abstract could be tightened - it's quite long (1 paragraph, ~200 words).
2. Some figure captions could include the number of treated/control states.
3. The reference list mixes hand-written thebibliography with some inconsistent formatting.

## Assessment

The revisions adequately address the issues raised in Round 1. The paper is now ready for external review.
