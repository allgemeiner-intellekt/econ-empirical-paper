## Follow-up Review After Round 1

This is a second-round internal review to verify that major concerns have been addressed.

### Status of Previous Concerns

1. **Spillover calculation consistency:** RESOLVED. The spillover WTP is now correctly converted from PPP to USD (245 PPP × 0.5 ratio / 2.515 = $49 per recipient). Table 4 reflects the corrected values.

2. **Missing CI for spillover + MCPF:** RESOLVED. All four specifications in Table 4 now have 95% CIs.

3. **Text-table consistency:** RESOLVED. The abstract, introduction, and conclusion all consistently report MVPF = 0.87 (direct) and 0.92 (with spillovers).

### Remaining Minor Issues

1. **Bootstrap uncertainty propagation:** The CI for direct MVPF remains very tight [0.86, 0.88]. This is technically correct since the direct WTP component ($850) has no uncertainty - it's the nominal transfer minus admin cost. The uncertainty comes only from the fiscal externality estimates, which are small (~$23). This is methodologically defensible but worth a footnote.

2. **MCPF clarity in text:** Page 3 discusses MCPF adjustment without specifying direct vs spillover. Gemini flagged this as potential confusion. A minor clarification would help.

3. **Annual vs PV tax distinction:** The distinction between annual income tax ($2.68) and PV income tax ($11.59) is clear in context but could be more explicit in the table notes.

### Format Verification

- Page count: 34 pages (PASS - exceeds 25 minimum)
- All figures render correctly
- All tables have complete data
- Bibliography is properly formatted

### Assessment

The paper has addressed the major concerns from the advisor review cycle. The remaining issues are minor clarifications that do not affect the core contribution or methodology.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
