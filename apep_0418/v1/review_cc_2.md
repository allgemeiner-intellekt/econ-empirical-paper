## Changes Since Round 1

- Added treatment proxy discussion (ACS vs LAUS, temporal coverage)
- Fixed coefficient magnitude explanation (footnote on local vs global effects)
- Added appendix table for alternative outcomes, heterogeneity, bivariate RDD
- Fixed donut RDD discussion to acknowledge sign flip
- Fixed rounding consistency throughout
- Added file.exists() guards in 06_tables.R
- Log-transformed balance test variables

## Remaining Issues

1. The small sample (N=40) is inherent to the design and cannot be fixed.
2. The coefficient magnitude remains large relative to the mean, but the footnote explains why.
3. 2023-only post-treatment window is a data limitation, acknowledged in text.

## Assessment

The paper has addressed all fixable issues from Round 1. The remaining concerns (power, coefficient magnitude, timing) are limitations of the research setting, not methodological errors. They are honestly discussed in the paper.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
