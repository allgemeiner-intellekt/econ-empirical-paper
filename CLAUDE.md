# Research Overview



## Writing a Paper

Use the `/econ-paper` skill to start an interactive economics paper writing workflow. The skill guides you through 8 stages from topic selection to compiled PDF.

```
/econ-paper
```

## Quality Standards

Papers produced by this workflow should meet:
- **25+ pages** with complete sections (abstract, introduction, institutional background, data, strategy, results, robustness, discussion, conclusion)
- **Publication-grade figures** — AER-style, colorblind-safe palette, clear axis labels
- **Quantitative specificity** — never "many states adopted," always "8 adoption cohorts, 40 treated states, 11 never-treated states"
- **Pre-analysis plan lockdown** — SHA-256 hash prevents post-hoc specification changes
- **Three-layer robustness** — design (alternative estimators), sample (subsamples), specification (alternative fixed effects)
- **Honest limitations** — explicit boundaries on what results can/cannot establish
