\item Notes: Treatment quarter is the first full calendar quarter in which the law is in effect; when a law takes effect on the first day of a quarter, that quarter is the treatment quarter. The top panel lists 13 states included as treated in the primary specification (with at least one post-treatment quarter in the QCEW data ending 2025Q2). The bottom panel lists 6 states classified as not-yet-treated because their treatment quarters fall at or after the end of the QCEW sample. Florida is excluded from the primary specification due to its unique \$1 billion revenue threshold. Sources: IAPP State Privacy Legislation Tracker, individual state statutes.
