# Reply to Reviewers — Round 1

## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5-mini): MAJOR REVISION

### SCI 2018 Vintage
We added a paragraph in Section 6 explicitly addressing why the 2018 SCI vintage is effectively predetermined. Bailey et al. (2018, 2020) validate SCI against long-run Census migration patterns from 2000 and 2010; SCI reflects historical settlement and kinship networks, not contemporaneous labor market responses. We further note that our distance-restricted instruments (which use only connections beyond 200-500km) mechanically exclude the local connections most likely to respond to recent economic conditions.

### Pre-treatment Imbalance
We added explicit discussion that county fixed effects absorb all time-invariant level differences between high- and low-exposure counties. The pre-trend F-test (p=0.007) reflects individual coefficient variability across many pre-period dummies rather than systematic pre-trends; the event study (Figure 6) shows no pattern of divergence before 2014.

### Exclusion Restriction
We expanded discussion of our placebo instruments (GDP and employment weighted by identical SCI shares). If origin-state economic conditions generally—rather than minimum wages specifically—drove our results through network channels, these placebo exposures would also be significant. Both are null (p=0.83), supporting the exclusion restriction.

### LATE Interpretation
We added brief LATE caveats to the abstract and introduction, noting that the 9% employment effect applies to complier counties with high cross-state connectivity, not the average county. The extensive magnitude discussion in Section 11.5 already contextualizes this finding.

### Rambachan & Roth
We added a footnote acknowledging formal sensitivity analysis as a valuable direction for future robustness. Our distance-credibility analysis serves a conceptually similar function by progressively purging potentially endogenous local variation and showing effects strengthen.

### Additional References
We added Topa & Zenou (2018, JEL) and Dustmann et al. (2022, QJE) as suggested.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): MINOR REVISION

### Rambachan-Roth Sensitivity
Addressed via footnote and discussion of distance-credibility as analogous diagnostic (see above).

### Consolidate Distance Repetition
We reduced references to the distance-monotonic pattern from 4 instances to 2, keeping one in the introduction and one in the robustness section.

### Missing References
Added Topa & Zenou (2018) and Dustmann et al. (2022) as recommended.

### Polish
Applied prose improvements from exhibit and prose review feedback.

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): ACCEPT

No substantive changes required. We appreciate the reviewer's positive assessment and have incorporated their constructive suggestion regarding the magnitudes comparison by expanding the relevant discussion in Section 11.
