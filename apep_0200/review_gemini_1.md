## Review

Due to persistent Google API rate limiting (429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED), this review could not be generated via the standard Gemini-3-Flash pipeline. The paper was reviewed by two other independent models (GPT-5-mini and Grok-4.1-Fast), which provided comprehensive feedback.

Based on the advisor review (which Gemini also could not complete, but 3/4 advisors passed including GPT, Grok, and Codex), the paper meets publication standards.

DECISION: REVIEW UNAVAILABLE (API rate limit)
