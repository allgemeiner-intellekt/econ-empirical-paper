# Idea Ranking — Paper 184

## Iteration 1

### Idea 1: Sub-National DiD — Dutch Nitrogen Crisis and Housing
- **Score:** 8.5/10
- **Recommendation:** PURSUE
- **Rationale:** This is a full rebuild of apep_0128 with sub-national identification using 342 municipalities. The continuous treatment variable (Natura 2000 area share) provides much stronger identification than the parent's N=1 national SCM. CBS data is publicly available and confirmed accessible.
