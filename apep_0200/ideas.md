# Research Ideas — Paper 184 (Revision of apep_0128)

## Idea 1: Sub-National DiD — Dutch Nitrogen Crisis and Housing
**Policy:** May 29, 2019 Dutch Council of State ruling invalidating the PAS nitrogen permit system
**Outcome:** CBS 83625ENG municipality housing prices + CBS 83671NED building permits
**Identification:** Continuous treatment (N2000 area share) × post-ruling DiD with municipality + year FEs
**Why it's novel:** Parent paper (apep_0128) used national-level SCM with N=1 and p=0.69. This rebuild exploits within-country geographic variation across 342 municipalities.
**Feasibility check:** Confirmed — CBS data covers 342 municipalities, GIS treatment constructed, variation is substantial (mean N2000 share = 14.4%, range 0-99.5%)
