# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (internal, post-revision)
**Paper:** No Snow Day Left Behind (revised)
**Date:** 2026-02-19

## PART 1: CRITICAL REVIEW

### Issues Addressed from Round 1

1. **Treatment timing:** Corrected. The paper now clearly states `g_s = adopt_year + 1` and the example (adoption 2021 → first treated winter 2022) is consistent with the code.

2. **Storm interaction framing:** Improved. The paper now uses "suggestive evidence" and "marginally significant" throughout.

3. **Pre-COVID subsample:** Column 4 now includes a note explaining N=504 (8 pre-COVID adopters + 28 never-treated × 14 winters).

4. **Regional heterogeneity:** Table added (Table A1). No region is significant.

5. **Sun-Abraham:** Table added (Table A2). Consistent with CS-DiD null.

### Remaining Issues

1. **Summer placebo still significant:** The paper discusses this but it remains a concern for strict falsification.

2. **Winsorization claim removed:** Good — the text now correctly states no winsorization was applied.

3. **Working parent share removed from summary stats:** Appropriate given the ACS variable construction ambiguity.

## PART 2: CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS

The paper is now internally consistent. The main limitation is the proxy outcome, which is acknowledged. The revision addressed all critical issues from Round 1.
