## Note

This review was not generated due to an API error (JSON parsing failure) during the external review process. The other two reviewers (Grok-4.1-Fast and Gemini-3-Flash) completed their reviews successfully, both recommending MINOR REVISION.

Given the consensus from the two completed reviews and the successful passage of the quad-model advisor review (all 4 PASS), the paper proceeds with 2/3 external reviews.

DECISION: MINOR REVISION (inferred from peer consensus)
