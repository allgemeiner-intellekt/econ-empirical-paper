\textit{Notes:} All values in percentage points. Permutation inference based on 500 random reassignments. Municipality-level permutation shuffles language and religion labels across municipalities independently. Canton-level permutation shuffles confessional status at the canton level, respecting the historical assignment mechanism, while keeping municipality-level language labels fixed; 3 of 500 canton-level permutations produced perfect collinearity and are excluded, yielding 497 valid permutations. Two-sided $p$-values report the fraction of permuted coefficients with absolute value at least as large as the observed coefficient. Reported as $< 1/N$ when no permutation exceeds the observed value.
