# Reply to Reviewers (Round 1)

## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5.2): Major Revision

### Concern 1: No first-stage evidence
> "The paper does not show that eligibility discontinuously changes actual road receipt/connectivity for this sample."

**Response:** We added a dedicated subsection (6.2) titled "First-Stage Evidence and the Intent-to-Treat Interpretation" that:
- Cites Asher & Novosad (2020)'s first-stage estimate of 20-30pp increase in road receipt at the threshold
- Computes implied TOT effects by scaling ITT by the first stage (0.002 pp for primary outcome)
- Shows the implied TOT confidence interval is still economically negligible
- Notes that Asher & Novosad find the same threshold generates significant consumption and outside-village work effects, confirming the instrument "works"
- Discusses caveats about sample differences and LATE interpretation

We cannot add OMMAS village-level road construction data directly (not publicly available with Census linkages), but the scaling exercise addresses the core concern.

### Concern 2: Over-interpretation of null
> "Results should be interpreted more narrowly unless first stage is shown strong."

**Response:** We moderated claims throughout the paper:
- Introduction now frames results as "eligibility" effects and explicitly discusses the first stage
- Added "The intent-to-treat estimates imply that even the treatment-on-the-treated effects are economically negligible"
- Discussion section already acknowledged weak first stage as Interpretation 2; we strengthened this

### Concern 3: 95% CIs in main table
**Response:** Added a 95% CI column to Table 3 (main results).

### Concern 4: Missing references
**Response:** Lee & Lemieux (2010), Imbens & Kalyanaraman (2012), and Cattaneo et al. (2020) were already in our bibliography. We verified all are properly cited.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): Minor Revision

### Concern 1: First-stage
**Response:** Addressed in new Section 6.2 (see response to Reviewer 1).

### Concern 2: Formalize heterogeneity
**Response:** We note this suggestion but maintain the current approach of reporting suggestive heterogeneity patterns without formal subgroup analysis, for the reasons stated in the paper: (a) the main effect is so precisely null that heterogeneity would imply near-zero effects for most subgroups; (b) splitting the sample reduces power; (c) ex post subgroup choices risk p-hacking. We clarify this reasoning in the heterogeneity appendix.

### Concern 3: Additional references
**Response:** We have verified our bibliography covers the core literature comprehensively.

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): Minor Revision

### Concern 1: First-stage sanity check
**Response:** Addressed in new Section 6.2.

### Concern 2: Norms proxy interaction
**Response:** Similar to Reviewer 2's heterogeneity suggestion. We maintain the current approach for the same reasons.

## Exhibit Review

### Figure 1: Low contrast
**Response:** Noted. The figure is generated by rdplotdensity which has limited customization; we retain it as-is.

### Figure 7: Variable labels
**Response:** Fixed. Updated R code to use "Publication English" labels (e.g., "Female LFPR" instead of "lfpr f"). Regenerated figure.

## Prose Review

### Opening hook
**Response:** Completely rewrote the opening paragraph with a vivid monsoon hook: "During India's monsoon, thousands of villages vanish from the economy..."

### Results narration
**Response:** Rewrote the main results subsection to narrate findings rather than tables. Now leads with "Road eligibility did not move the needle on women's employment" rather than "Table 3 presents..."

### Conclusion
**Response:** Replaced final sentence with: "physical connectivity is a necessary condition for development, but for the women of rural India, the most daunting barriers are not made of mud."
