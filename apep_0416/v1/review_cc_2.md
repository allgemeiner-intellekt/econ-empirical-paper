## Changes Since Round 1

1. Consolidated summary statistics into a single Table 1 with Panel A/B — cleaner presentation.
2. Moved Figures 3, 4, 7 to appendix — main text now focuses on key results.
3. Improved opening hook — more vivid, immediately establishes stakes.
4. Removed roadmap paragraph — tighter introduction.
5. Improved results narration with active voice.
6. Fixed all coefficient values to match truncated data (Oct 2024 endpoint).
7. Fixed data description ("227 million claim-line records" not "4.3 million rows at state-category-month level").

## Remaining Issues

1. **Minor:** The paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion of why HCBS is a valid comparison group (e.g., similar administrative structure, same state agencies, but different patient population).
2. **Minor:** Table numbering in the appendix should be verified for consistency after moving figures.

## Assessment

The paper has improved meaningfully since Round 1. The prose is tighter, the exhibits are better organized, and the data description is accurate. The core contribution — a well-identified null demonstrating provider market resilience — is clearly communicated.

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
