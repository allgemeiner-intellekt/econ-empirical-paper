# Reply to Reviewers — Round 1

## Reviewer 1 (Gemini-3-Flash): MINOR REVISION

> **Suggestion 1:** Add more peer-reviewed empirical work on the "Great Resignation" in education; cite Biasi (2021) on teacher pay schemes.

**Response:** We have added Biasi (2021) to the bibliography and cited it in the Discussion section when discussing why compensation dominates legislative conditions as a determinant of teacher supply.

> **Suggestion 2:** Consider IPUMS CPS data for gender shifts in "Secondary School Teachers" vs "Elementary School Teachers."

**Response:** This is an excellent suggestion that would strengthen the compositional finding. However, the CPS sample sizes for state-level teacher employment by gender and occupation are very small, and the analysis would require a separate data pipeline. We note this as a promising avenue for future work in the Discussion section.

> **Suggestion 3:** Look at state-level teacher preparation program enrollment (Title II data).

**Response:** Another excellent suggestion for the "deterrent effect on entry" mechanism. Title II data could show pipeline effects that precede labor market effects. We acknowledge this limitation and note it as future work.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): MINOR REVISION

> **Suggestion 1:** Add Bleemer (2023) on affirmative action bans as a parallel case of regulatory chill in education.

**Response:** Added to the bibliography and cited in the Discussion section alongside the regulatory chill hypothesis. Bleemer's finding that affirmative action bans affected university enrollment provides a useful contrast — those bans had measurable effects on educational outcomes, while content restriction laws did not measurably affect teacher labor markets.

> **Suggestion 2:** Add Hanushek & Rivkin (2012) on teacher quality/mobility.

**Response:** Added to the bibliography.

> **Suggestion 3:** Vary null phrasing to reduce repetition.

**Response:** Revised several instances to use varied language (e.g., "no detectable effect," "precisely estimated zero," "absence of aggregate labor market disruption," "economically negligible").

> **Suggestion 4:** Fix Panel D formatting in Table 2.

**Response:** Panel D now displays the female share result clearly as a single-row summary with the coefficient, standard error, and p-value.
