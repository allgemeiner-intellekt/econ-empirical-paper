# Revision Plan — Round 1

## Summary of Reviewer Feedback

- **Gemini-3-Flash**: MINOR REVISION. Praised methodology, identification, and writing. Suggested (1) add teacher labor supply literature (Biasi 2021), (2) consider CPS data for compositional finding, (3) look at teacher preparation enrollment data.
- **Grok-4.1-Fast**: MINOR REVISION. Called it a "methodological tour-de-force" and "gold standard for staggered DiD." Suggested (1) add 2-3 references (Bleemer 2023 on affirmative action bans, Hanushek & Rivkin 2012), (2) vary null phrasing, (3) fix Panel D table formatting.
- **GPT-5-mini**: No review (0 output tokens — API issue).

## Changes to Make

### 1. Add Suggested References
- Add Biasi (2021) on teacher labor market pay schemes
- Add Bleemer (2023) on affirmative action bans (regulatory chill parallel)
- These strengthen the literature positioning without requiring textual overhaul

### 2. Minor Prose Improvements
- Vary "null" phrasing in a few places to reduce repetition
- Noted by Grok as minor polish item

### 3. Not Addressed (Out of Scope)
- CPS microdata analysis (would require new data pipeline — save for revision)
- NAICS 6111 subsector (not available in QWI at needed granularity)
- State-time linear trends (CS and event studies already sufficient)
- K-12 administrative data (would require new data source)

These are excellent suggestions for a future revision but exceed the scope of minor revisions.
