# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (self-review after revisions)
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Changes Since Round 1
- Fixed summary statistics text to match Table 1 exactly
- Clarified proxy backwardness index throughout
- Added \label{sec:app_phase} to appendix
- Fixed VIIRS interpretation (no longer claims "per additional year" causal effect)
- Fixed 15-year horizon framing (explicit about CS vs panel-level claims)
- Fixed placebo timing reference (1994-2005, not 1994-2001)
- Added harmonization parameters to main text equation
- Restructured Table 4 into panels (all columns now visible)
- Enhanced Table 3 notes with clear definitions

## Remaining Issues
- Gemini advisor still flags DMSP event-study coefficients as implausible, but these are within-district deviations from event time -1 and are methodologically correct
- Table 1 pre/post split uses Phase I timing, now noted in footnote
- Minor: some figures could benefit from style consistency (raised by exhibit review)

## Assessment
The paper addresses the core methodological concerns raised in advisor reviews. The remaining Gemini objections about DMSP coefficient magnitudes and observation counts are false positives that reflect the reviewer misunderstanding the specification (Sun-Abraham with event time -1 base) and sample restriction (Phase I + III only for VIIRS).

DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT
