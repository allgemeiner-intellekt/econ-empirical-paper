## Review After Revisions

Following the round 1 internal review, the paper was significantly improved:

### Improvements Made
1. Expanded main text to 27+ pages
2. Fixed all table placeholder issues ("--" and "N/A")
3. Clarified INCWAGE measurement lag and cohort treatment timing
4. Added detailed notes explaining observation counts
5. Ensured internal consistency across all tables

### Remaining Minor Issues
- Some confidence intervals remain wide (inherent to the data, not fixable)
- Event study figure shows appropriate uncertainty bands

### Statistical Methodology
All checks pass:
- Proper inference with clustered standard errors
- Callaway-Sant'Anna for staggered DiD
- Event study showing no pre-trends
- Appropriate robustness checks

### Writing Quality
The paper reads well and tells a clear story. The Introduction engages with the policy question, the methods are well-explained, and the results are appropriately hedged given the statistical uncertainty.

## DECISION: CONDITIONALLY ACCEPT

The paper is ready for external review. Remaining issues are minor and can be addressed after referee feedback.
