# Research Ideas

## Idea 1: Salary History Bans and Wage Compression (RECOMMENDED)

**Policy:** State salary history ban laws (2017-2023)

Twenty-two states have prohibited employers from asking job applicants about their prior salary. Massachusetts was first (2016), followed by California, New York, New Jersey, and others through 2023.

**Key dates:**
- Massachusetts: August 2016 (effective July 2018)
- California: January 2018
- Delaware: December 2017
- New York State: January 2020
- Colorado: January 2021
- Plus 17 more states through 2023

**Outcome:** Overall wage dispersion/compression (Gini coefficient, 90/10 ratio, variance of log wages)

**Identification:** Staggered difference-in-differences using Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) estimator.

**Novel angle:** Existing research (Hansen and McNichols 2020, NBER 27054) focuses on gender wage gaps. I study the effect on overall wage inequality. Theory: When employers cannot anchor to prior salary, wage distributions may compress.

**Feasibility check:**
- Variation: 22 states treated, staggered adoption = excellent for DiD
- Data: ACS via IPUMS (INCWAGE by state-year)
- Novelty: Existing papers focus only on gender gap
- Sample: ACS has millions of observations per year

**Power assessment:**
- Pre-treatment periods: 2012-2017 (5+ years)
- Treated clusters: 22 states
- Post-treatment: 2018-2024

## Idea 2: Medicaid Expansion and Healthcare Worker Wages

**Policy:** ACA Medicaid expansion (2014+)

Forty states expanded Medicaid eligibility; 10 did not. Staggered adoption 2014-2024.

**Outcome:** Wages and employment for healthcare workers (nurses, aides)

**Identification:** Staggered DiD with CS estimator.

**Novel angle:** Literature studies enrollee outcomes. I study provider market equilibrium.

**Feasibility check:**
- Variation: 40 treated states = excellent
- Data: QCEW for industry wages; ACS for occupation-specific
- Novelty: Existing papers focus on enrollees

## Idea 3: Universal License Recognition and Entrepreneurship

**Policy:** Universal license recognition laws (2019-2024)

Twenty-six states passed ULR laws recognizing out-of-state licenses.

**Outcome:** New business formation in licensed occupations

**Identification:** Staggered DiD.

**Novel angle:** NBER 34030 studies healthcare utilization. I study entrepreneurship.

**Feasibility check:**
- Variation: 26 states by 2024
- Data: Census Business Dynamics Statistics
- Limitation: Recent policy limits post-period

## Recommendation

**Pursue Idea 1:** Best combination of novelty, identification quality, and data availability.
