# Idea Ranking (Revision)

## Parent: apep_0445 v2

This is a revision, not a new paper. The research question and identification strategy are inherited.

### Revision Priority: Add direct data center location measurement

**Rank 1 (only idea):** Revise apep_0445 to address reviewer concerns about NAICS 51 proxy by adding direct data center locations from EIA-860 and EPA GHGRP, engage with concurrent papers by Gargano & Giacoletti (2025) and Jaros (2026), and reframe around incentive hierarchy.
