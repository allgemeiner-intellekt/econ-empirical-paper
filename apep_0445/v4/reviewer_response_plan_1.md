# Reviewer Response Plan

## Priorities (by severity)

### HIGH PRIORITY (GPT + Grok)

1. **DC event counts within bandwidth** — Report number of tracts with ≥1 DC left/right of cutoff for each specification. Add to DC RDD tables.
2. **Local randomization effect sizes** — Report difference-in-means and randomization-based CIs alongside Fisher p-values in Table 9.
3. **Missing references** — Add Cattaneo et al. (2020) book, Imbens & Lemieux (2008), Hahn et al. (2001), Neumark & Simpson (2015).
4. **Vintage analysis power caveat** — Label post-2018 DC results as "suggestive" given extreme sparsity.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (GPT + Prose)

5. **Estimand clarity paragraph in Introduction** — Add "what we can/cannot identify" early.
6. **Prose improvements** — Refine roadmap, active voice in results, tighten transitions.
7. **NMTC mention in main text** — Elevate from footnote per prose review.

### LOW PRIORITY (nice to have)

8. **Additional heterogeneity** — Note as limitation; data constraints prevent fiber/electricity proxies.
9. **Density at placebo cutoffs** — Mention heaping at round numbers as supporting evidence.
