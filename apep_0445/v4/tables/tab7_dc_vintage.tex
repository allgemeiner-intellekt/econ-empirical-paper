\item \textit{Notes:} Parametric linear probability model within a $\pm 15$ percentage-point bandwidth with HC1 standard errors. Nonparametric \texttt{rdrobust} is infeasible for these outcomes due to extreme sparsity (fewer than 5 treated tracts with vintage DCs in the RDD sample). Panel A reports estimates for data centers with initial commercial operation in 2018 or later (treatment-relevant flow). Panel B reports estimates for pre-2018 facilities (placebo: should show no discontinuity since these predate OZ designation). Operating year from EIA Form 860 generator-level data. Because all post-2018 and pre-2018 tracts have exactly one facility, the binary and count outcomes are mechanically identical. Post-2018 base rate: 0.011\%. MDE at 80\% power: 0.046 pp. * $p<0.10$, ** $p<0.05$, *** $p<0.01$.
