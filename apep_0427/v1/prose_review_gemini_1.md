# Section-by-Section Review

## The Opening
**Verdict:** [Solid but needs a sharper hook]

The opening paragraph is professional and clear, but it misses the "Shleifer Hook"—that vivid, concrete observation that makes the reader stop scrolling. You start with a big number (€15 billion), which is good, but you frame it in a conventional academic way.

*   **Critique:** "Between 2019 and 2024, France experienced the largest apprenticeship expansion in modern European history." This is a true statement, but it’s a category. 
*   **Suggested Rewrite:** Start with the human/firm incentive to make it inevitable. 
    > "In 2022, a French firm hiring a 20-year-old apprentice received a €8,000 check from the government—covering nearly the worker's entire first-year wage. Unsurprisingly, apprenticeship contracts tripled in five years. The question is whether the state bought new jobs or simply paid for hiring that would have happened anyway."

## Introduction
**Verdict:** [Shleifer-ready]

This is the strongest part of the paper. You follow the arc perfectly: Motivation → What we do → What we find → Why it matters. 

*   **The "What We Find" preview:** This is excellent. You don't say "we find positive effects"; you provide the Bartik coefficient (0.074) and interpret it immediately ("1.3 percentage point larger increase in youth share"). This is exactly what a busy economist needs.
*   **The "Contribution" section:** It’s honest. You cite Crépon and Premand (2025) and distinguish your work by context (rich vs. developing country). This builds trust.
*   **The Roadmap:** You included the "The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows..." paragraph. Shleifer would tell you to delete it. If your section headers are clear, the reader doesn't need a table of contents in prose form.

## Background / Institutional Context
**Verdict:** [Vivid and necessary]

Section 2.6 ("International Comparison") is pure Shleifer/Glaeser. It puts the French experience in a global cage-match with Germany and the UK.
*   **Strength:** The detail about the consulting firm hiring an MBA graduate and calling it an "apprenticeship" is the perfect concrete example. It makes the "relabeling" concept feel real, not just a theoretical possibility.
*   **Minor Polish:** Section 2.7 (Political Economy) is interesting but borders on "narrative energy" that might distract. Keep it tight.

## Data
**Verdict:** [Reads as narrative]

You successfully avoid the "Variable X comes from source Y" trap. 
*   **Strength:** Integrating the *Indeed* vacancy data is a masterstroke for "narrative energy." It shows you are looking at the world in real-time.
*   **Improvement:** In section 4.2, when describing the exposure measure, tell us *why* we should care about the 18% in construction vs 2% in public admin before the math. Ground the variation in the industry's nature.

## Empirical Strategy
**Verdict:** [Clear to non-specialists]

You explain the logic before the Greek letters.
*   **Critique:** "The identifying assumption is that sectors with higher pre-reform apprenticeship intensity experienced a proportionally larger 'dose'..." This is clean.
*   **Suggestion:** Use a Glaeser-style sentence to land the intuition: "We essentially compare the hiring behavior of builders—who are addicted to apprentices—against bankers, who barely use them, as the subsidy was pulled back."

## Results
**Verdict:** [Tells a story]

You do a great job of telling the reader what they *learned* (Katz-style).
*   **Strength:** "The fact that total employment also responded differentially suggests that sectors with high apprenticeship intensity were on generally favorable employment trajectories... the subsidy captured rather than caused this growth." This is sophisticated, honest writing.
*   **Quote to keep:** "The €6,000 per contract buys a change of name, not a change of opportunity." (This should be in the Abstract).

## Discussion / Conclusion
**Verdict:** [Resonates]

The "Symmetric Test" (Section 6.6) is the intellectual heart of the paper. 
*   **Strength:** Comparing the "Introduction" effect vs the "Reduction" effect is a brilliant way to structure the logic.
*   **The Final Punch:** Your closing sentence is strong, but could be even punchier.

## Overall Writing Assessment

- **Current level:** Top-journal ready. The prose is significantly better than the median AER/QJE submission.
- **Greatest strength:** The "Symmetric Test" logic—it makes the findings feel inevitable.
- **Greatest weakness:** Occasional "throat-clearing" in the early paragraphs of sections.
- **Shleifer test:** Yes. A smart non-economist would understand the stakes by the end of page 1.

### Top 5 Concrete Improvements

1.  **Kill the Roadmap:** Delete the last paragraph of the Introduction. Let the headers do the work.
2.  **Punchier Abstract Closing:** Change the last sentence of the abstract to: "The subsidy bought a change of name, not a change of opportunity."
3.  **Active Voice in Results:** Change "The pattern is inconsistent with the hypothesis..." to "The data reject the hypothesis that subsidies created net new positions."
4.  **Simplify Transitions:** In Section 5.4, instead of "I verify that no major labor market legislation took effect," use "No other major labor reforms happened at the same time."
5.  **Vivid Summaries:** In Table 3's discussion, don't just say "Column 2 examines youth employment levels." Say: "In absolute terms, the subsidy reduction did not cost a single job; in fact, the most exposed sectors added 61,000 youth workers."
