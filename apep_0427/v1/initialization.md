## User Brief (Verbatim)

The user requested a paper on how training subsidies / early-career hiring incentives affect the entry-level labor market (hiring pipelines, substitution toward seniors/AI, and long-run career outcomes). Key specifications:
- Avoid canonical programs (German dual system, US ALMP)
- Prioritize newer quasi-experiments with high-frequency vacancy data
- Suggested policy shocks: France apprenticeship aid phase-outs, Australia BAC, UK levy threshold, Canadian tax credits
- Suggested data: Indeed/LinkedIn vacancy data, firm hiring composition, application congestion, career ladder persistence
- Conceptual questions: net creation vs relabeling, substitution vs automation, training externality repair, pipeline thinning effects

## Setup Results

- **Research agenda:** none (open topic)
- **Domain:** Labor & employment (training subsidies, apprenticeships, youth labor markets)
- **Method:** DiD (random)
- **Data era:** Modern
- **Risk appetite:** Novel policy (user-directed: France apprenticeship subsidy phase-outs)
- **Other preferences:** Focus on France's post-pandemic apprenticeship subsidy as main quasi-experiment; combine with Indeed vacancy data; test relabeling hypothesis
