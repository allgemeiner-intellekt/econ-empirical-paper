# Internal Review - Round 1

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal)
**Paper:** Parity Without Payoff? v3 revision
**Date:** 2026-02-21

## Summary

This is a v3 revision of apep_0433. The paper exploits France's 1,000-inhabitant threshold in a sharp RDD to test whether mandated gender parity in municipal councils affects female economic outcomes and intermediate policy channels.

## Key Strengths

1. **Comprehensive channel testing:** The paper tests six outcome families (labor, pipeline, spending, facilities, entrepreneurship, council composition), providing the broadest test of the representation-to-outcomes chain in a single study.
2. **Novel BPE facility data:** Using commune-level public equipment data (childcare, social services) as outcomes is a genuine contribution.
3. **Pre-specified outcome hierarchy:** The Primary (Holm-corrected) / Secondary (raw) / Exploratory structure is well-designed and addresses multiple testing concerns transparently.
4. **Strong institutional knowledge:** The paper demonstrates deep understanding of French electoral law, municipal finance, and the BPE classification system.

## Suggestions

1. The fuzzy IV results (Appendix Table 7) have SE > 1.0 for LFPR. Consider adding a footnote explicitly stating these are non-informative.
2. The education facilities result (p=0.015) stands out among 16 secondary outcomes. The paper correctly notes this but could add a sentence about the expected false positive rate.
3. The 40/60 pre/post split for RP2021 is well-discussed but could benefit from a brief note about the 2014 mandate creating the same threshold.

## Minor Issues

- BPE vintage should be consistently "2024" everywhere (some table notes still say 2023 — now fixed)
- Several text-table number mismatches were identified and corrected

DECISION: MINOR REVISION
