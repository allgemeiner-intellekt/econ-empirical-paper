# Reviewer Response Plan

## Grouped Concerns

### 1. Compound Treatment Framing (GPT-5.2, Gemini)
- GPT: Exclusion restriction for fuzzy IV not credible for "netting out PR"
- Gemini: Treatment intensity ambiguity — 2.74pp vs 100% in India
- **Action:** Strengthen the "bundled electoral reform" framing; explicitly acknowledge the IV limitation; add treatment intensity discussion with distributional evidence

### 2. Outcome Timing (GPT-5.2)
- RP2021 mixes pre/post; BPE is stock not flow
- **Action:** Already addressed in text (40/60 split + 2014 mandate overlap). Add note about BPE stock vs flow in limitations.

### 3. Multiple Testing (GPT-5.2)
- Secondary outcomes use raw p-values
- **Action:** The pre-specified hierarchy already addresses this. Add a sentence noting that Benjamini-Hochberg within secondary families would not change conclusions.

### 4. Prose & Formatting (Grok, Prose Review)
- Remove roadmap paragraph ✓
- Sharpen hedge language ✓
- Add concrete institutional examples ✓

### 5. Missing Literature (Grok)
- Add Gagliarducci & Paserman (2016), and note Italian quota literature
- **Action:** Add 1-2 references in discussion section

### 6. Exhibit Improvements (Exhibit Review)
- Promote 3,500 validation table to main text consideration
- **Action:** Already in appendix with clear cross-reference; keep as-is for space

## Prose Workstream
- Removed roadmap paragraph ✓
- Sharpened "mayor null" language ✓
- Added concrete institutional example in Section 2.1 ✓
