# Revision Plan: APEP 0433 v3 — Expanding the Causal Chain

## Parent Paper
- **ID:** apep_0433 v2
- **Decision:** MAJOR REVISION (GPT-5.2)

## Key Changes
1. **BPE Equipment Data**: Commune-level facility counts (crèches, social centres, sports, health) — tests policy priorities through infrastructure stock
2. **RNE Adjoint Expansion**: Parse adjoint positions for female representation in executive pipeline
3. **DGFIP Account Expansion**: Culture, environment, personnel spending + spending HHI
4. **Pre-specified Outcome Hierarchy**: Primary/secondary/exploratory with Holm correction
5. **Paper Restructure**: Forest plot moved earlier, validation to appendix, consolidated tables
6. **Literature Expansion**: Clots-Figueras, Folke & Rickne, Lippmann
7. **Compound Treatment Reframing**: "Bundled electoral reform" language throughout

## Reviewer Concerns Addressed
- Compound treatment → reframe + PR-signature tests
- Outcome timing → explicit quantification + 2016 intermediate
- Small treatment intensity → female share distribution near cutoff
- Pre-specify hierarchy → new table with adjusted p-values
- Missing literature → 5+ new references
- Consolidate tables → merge political + spending
- Move validation to appendix → done
