\item Notes: Each row reports a separate RDD at the 1,000-inhabitant threshold. Female mayor is an indicator (elected by the council, not mechanically determined by parity). Number of councillors is the total council size. CER-optimal bandwidths differ across outcomes ($h = 185$ for mayor, $h = 98$ for councillors), explaining the sample size difference. Data from RNE 2025 (reflecting 2020 election). Local linear regression, triangular kernel.
