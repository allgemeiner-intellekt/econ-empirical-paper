# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (Internal, Round 2)
**Paper:** Parity Without Payoff? Gender Quotas in French Local Government
**Date:** 2026-02-21

## Changes Since Round 1

Round 1 suggested: (1) move fuzzy IV to appendix, (2) add heterogeneity analysis, (3) discuss timing more carefully. These are constructive suggestions for improvement, not blocking issues.

## Remaining Issues

1. **Missing RDD methodology references:** The paper should cite Lee & Lemieux (2010) and Cattaneo, Idrobo & Titiunik (2019/2020) as foundational RDD references.

2. **Fuzzy IV presentation:** Still in main text. Not a fatal flaw but could strengthen the paper by demoting to appendix.

## Assessment

The paper is methodologically sound. The RDD design is credible, the null results are honestly reported with appropriate caveats, and the expanded outcome families (spending, political pipeline, entrepreneurship) represent a meaningful contribution beyond the v1 paper. The writing is clear and well-organized.

**DECISION: MINOR REVISION**
