## Response to GPT-5.2 (Reviewer 1 — Major Revision)

**1. Compound treatment / estimand framing**
We agree the main estimand is the effect of the 1,000-inhabitant electoral regime change (PR + parity), not parity alone. The paper now frames the reduced-form estimates as effects of this bundle throughout, treating parity-specific claims as interpretive hypotheses supported by indirect evidence.

**2. 3,500 validation interpretation**
We have rewritten all references to the 3,500 exercise as an "exposure duration" comparison (parity since 2000 above vs. since 2014 below), not as a clean isolation of parity from PR. This is now consistent across abstract, introduction, methods, results, and figure notes.

**3. Fuzzy RD-IV exclusion restriction and presentation**
We acknowledge the exclusion restriction is strong and have added explicit caveats. The IV results are now presented with proper unit scaling (per-unit on 0-1 scale, with per-1-pp conversion noted). We direct readers to the reduced-form as more informative.

**4. Missing RDD references**
Added Imbens & Lemieux (2008) and Lee & Lemieux (2010) citations in the methodology section. Besley et al. (2017) added to the discussion.

**5. CIs for fuzzy IV table**
The fuzzy IV table notes now clearly explain the scaling and CER-optimal bandwidth selection that produces different N from the reduced-form tables.

## Response to Grok-4.1-Fast (Reviewer 2 — Minor Revision)

**1. Missing RDD references**
Added Imbens & Lemieux (2008) citation. Lee & Lemieux (2010) was already present.

**2. Gold-standard assessment**
We appreciate the positive assessment and have maintained the diagnostic transparency throughout the revision.

## Response to Gemini-3-Flash (Reviewer 3 — Minor Revision)

**1. Besley et al. (2017) "Mediocre Man" reference**
Added to references.bib and cited in the Discussion section. This provides a selection-quality mechanism that complements our spending/pipeline analysis.

**2. Spending classification**
We acknowledge the nature-based vs. functional classification limitation in Section 8.3. The DGFIP data we access uses nature codes; functional classification would require the "presentation croisée" dataset which is not consistently available for small communes.

**3. SESOI benchmarking**
We frame the 1 pp SESOI in context of the MDE analysis (Figure 9) and the India literature benchmarks.
