# Reviewer Response Plan - Round 1

## Workstream 1: Framing (GPT concern #3, #6A)
- Soften "first causal evaluation" language
- Add "estimand" clarification distinguishing ODF declarations from sanitation behavior
- Tighten claims to what the design can support

## Workstream 2: Missing References (GPT #4, Grok #4)
- Add de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020) to references.bib
- Add Borusyak, Jaravel & Spiess (2024) to references.bib
- Cite both in methodology section

## Workstream 3: Inference Improvements (GPT #2f)
- Note: Wild cluster bootstrap was already removed from claims (no longer promised)
- Add note about sensitivity to COVID exclusion (Gemini suggestion)

## Workstream 4: Minor Fixes (All reviewers)
- Define BIMARU acronym in text (Grok)
- Clean Table 2 note (GPT noted empty bullet)
- Remove "of course, implausible" rhetorical flourish (GPT #5c)

## Workstream 5: Prose (from prose review)
- Already addressed: stronger opening, better results narration, figure reordering

## Workstream 6: Exhibits (from exhibit review)
- Already addressed: Table 1 in millions/thousands, figures reordered
- Not implementing: CS-DiD column in Table 3 (current footnote approach is standard)

## Out of Scope (for this version)
- Rambachan-Roth sensitivity analysis (requires R implementation beyond current scope)
- District-level ODF dates (not available in current data)
- Village-level analysis (would require fundamentally different aggregation)
- Wild cluster bootstrap (would require fwildclusterboot package)
