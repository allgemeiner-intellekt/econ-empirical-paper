# Internal Review - Round 2

**Reviewer:** Claude Code (internal)
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Paper:** Does Sanitation Drive Development? Satellite Evidence from India's Swachh Bharat Mission

## Verdict: MINOR REVISION

## Summary

After addressing Round 1 concerns, the paper is substantially improved. The main findings are clearly presented, internal consistency is verified, and all figures/tables render correctly.

## Remaining Concerns

1. **Advisor review passed (3/4).** GPT-5.2, Grok-4.1-Fast, and Codex-Mini passed. Gemini raised some issues about Table 3 column alignment (now fixed with standard tabular) and the 2018 cohort significance (correctly described as not individually significant since t=1.14).

2. **Exhibit review suggests adding CS-DiD to Table 3.** This is a valid suggestion but the current approach (CS-DiD in table note) is acceptable and commonly used in the literature.

3. **Prose review suggests stronger opening and less jargon.** Opening has been improved. Some jargon reduction applied.

## Assessment

The paper is ready for external review. The identification strategy is honestly presented, the null result is well-documented, and the methodological lessons are clearly articulated.
