## Revision Information

**Parent Paper:** apep_0154
**Parent Title:** Shining Light on Paychecks: The Effects of Salary Transparency Laws on Wages and the Gender Pay Gap
**Parent Decision:** MAJOR REVISION
**Revision Rationale:** Address all reviewer concerns from v4 (1 MAJOR, 2 MINOR)

## Reviewer Concerns Being Addressed

Address all reviewer concerns from v4 (1 MAJOR, 2 MINOR):

1. **GPT-5-mini (MAJOR):** Inference with few treated clusters — add collapsed-cell wild cluster bootstrap, permutation/Fisher randomization inference, leave-one-treated-state-out sensitivity, HonestDiD for gender DDD
2. **Grok (MINOR):** Gender-stratified event studies need more prominence in paper text
3. **Gemini (MINOR):** Composition/selection balance tests, upper-distribution robustness, firm-size threshold heterogeneity, missing references

## Key Changes Planned

- WP1: Collapsed-cell wild cluster bootstrap for DDD
- WP2: Permutation/Fisher randomization inference (5,000 permutations)
- WP3: Leave-one-treated-state-out sensitivity
- WP4: HonestDiD for gender DDD specification
- WP5: Gender-stratified event studies in paper text
- WP6: Composition/selection balance tests
- WP7: Upper-distribution robustness (above 25th percentile)
- WP8: Missing references (5-6 citations)
- WP9: Firm-size threshold heterogeneity
