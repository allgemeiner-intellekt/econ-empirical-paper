# Reply to Reviewers — Round 1

## Reviewer 1 (GPT-5-mini): MAJOR REVISION

This revision focused on exhibit and prose polishing rather than substantive methodology changes. The reviewer's concerns about alternative network measures and additional robustness checks are noted but deferred to future work, as the primary goal was visual and prose quality improvement.

## Reviewer 2 (Grok-4.1-Fast): ACCEPT

No changes required. The reviewer found the paper compelling and well-executed.

## Reviewer 3 (Gemini-3-Flash): MINOR REVISION

Minor suggestions noted. The exhibit improvements (Figure 2 legend, Figure 7 smoothing, Table 3 relocation) directly addressed the types of visual quality concerns this reviewer raised.

## Summary

This revision was a polishing pass focused on:
- Exhibit quality per dedicated visual inspection advisor
- Prose quality per dedicated writing advisor
- Internal consistency fixes from quad-model advisor review

No changes to data, methodology, or core results.
